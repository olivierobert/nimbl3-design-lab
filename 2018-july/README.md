# Nimbl3 Design Lab - July 2018

**Book** a date. A photographer **shoots** your event. Download amazing **photos**. Repeat.

This loader is a short summary of the flow a user goes through when booking a photographer on [vcliq](https://vcliq.com/).

The main idea is to animate a green dot through the illustrations representing each aforementioned step. The dot acts:

1. The slot picked on the calendar

2. The lens of the camera 

3. The sun above the mountain ☀️

## Resources & Tools

* All animation done using [Popmotion](https://popmotion.io/)

* All SVG icon design done by [Mai](https://github.com/Maibhu)

## The Instructions
For this Design Lab session, we challenge you to design or build an eye-popping animated *loader* for either web, iOS, Android or even CLI. 
* Type of loader: animated text, GIF or SVG.
* Upload an image of the animated loader to Invision: https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/projects/prototypes/14719701. If you built the actual loader, uploaded video on Github or link to the repository are welcome. 
* We want to you to have as much freedom as needed. Don't hesitate to think about about new applications or techniques to bring uniqueness to your submission! It's not about doing an illustration, it's about a creative idea and thinking about cool animations.
